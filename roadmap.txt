    - set an interval for subramani - get the money into another investment
    - re-invest the interest into another investment
2. Need discipline to divide 24 hours into tangible buckets for outcome
    - spiritual
    - health
    - investmetns
        trading
        investing
        rental income
        commercial buildings

lot of useful features in nsetools.py
    - list of all URLs available - specifically gainer, losers, advance, decline , active, peer, history
    - ability to fetch history per symbol - this is useful to get historical data for 15 years
    - good feature request to fetch details of portfolio - if bulk offloads might be worthwhile to investigate

trading with python - interesting concept of using an yaml



ability to pick the right stock from the universe and then copmute its return over a period of time is more scientific
than to only speculate 
also ability to look at who is investing in this stock and what has been the historical trend in their approach
also look at what stocks do these people frequently invest to see if there is a pattern - ignore noise of people who 
sell on the same day
